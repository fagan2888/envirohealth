# Surviving Breast Cancer-- A Personal Calculator
#### EnviroHealth Georgetown Data Science Capstone Project
For most people, a cancer diagnosis immediately brings up one question—“what are my chances to beat this thing?” Currently there are two ways newly diagnosed patients can get answers. First, they consult their doctor. Second, they go dumpster-diving in the overwhelming world of the world wide web.  We propose a third way—a web-based calculator that takes into account a patient’s unique parameters and returns a personal survival estimate.

Our group used the data science pipeline to create a data product to benefit both cancer patients and their doctors. We analyzed over 30 years of breast cancer data, built a predictive model, and connected it to a web interface. In this repository you will find our trials and tribulations throughout this process.

This is what it looks like when you first open the calculator. You then select values for certain parameters from dropdown menus; for example-- your age, tumor stage Estrogen Receptor status, etc. When you hit “calculate” the variables are analyzed and you receive a result.
